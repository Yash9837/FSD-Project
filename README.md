3. Project Overview
(Briefly describe the problem your project solves and its real-world relevance ‚Äì 100‚Äì150 words)
 
Example:
"Manual attendance systems in classrooms are time-consuming and prone to errors or proxy marking. Our project automates this process using facial recognition to identify students and log attendance in real time, improving accuracy and saving faculty time."
 
4. Key Features
(List 4‚Äì6 main functionalities of your project)
 
Feature 1: Real-time face detection using OpenCV
Feature 2: Automatic timestamp-based attendance logging
Feature 3: Simple web dashboard to view records
Feature 4: Local database storage (SQLite)
Feature 5: User registration module for new students
5. Technologies & Tools Used
(Mention programming languages, frameworks, hardware, APIs, etc.)
 
Languages: Python, HTML/CSS
Libraries/Frameworks: OpenCV, Face Recognition, Flask
Database: SQLite
Tools: VS Code, Git/GitHub, Postman (if applicable)
Hardware (if any): Raspberry Pi, Webcam, etc.
 
 
6. Work Allocation
(Explain how tasks were divided among team members)
 
[Name]: Developed the facial recognition module and integrated it with the database.
[Name]: Designed and implemented the web interface using Flask.
[Name]: Managed version control, prepared documentation, and coordinated demo rehearsal.
7. Weekly Progress Summary
Week 1
Finalized idea, set up Python environment, researched face recognition libraries
Difficulty choosing between Haar Cascades vs. deep learning models
Selected
face_recognition
library for better accuracy
 
Week 2
Built face registration & recognition script; created basic UI
Webcam latency issues
Optimized frame capture rate
Week 3
Integrated database; tested full workflow; fixed login bugs
Attendance not saving correctly
Debugged SQL queries and added error handling
Week 4
Final testing, prepared presentation slides, rehearsed demo
Minor UI alignment issues
Adjusted CSS for responsive layout
 
8. Conclusion & Learning Outcomes
(Reflect on what you learned, what worked well, and possible future improvements ‚Äì 100‚Äì150 words)
 
Through this project, we gained hands-on experience in computer vision, full-stack integration, and teamwork. We successfully built a functional attendance system that reduces manual effort. Challenges like real-time processing taught us optimization techniques. In the future, we plan to add cloud storage, mobile support, and liveness detection to prevent spoofing.
